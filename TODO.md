      ```
        resolveModuleNames [ 'tslib', './main.js' ] /home/daniel/apps/civet/source/esm.civet
        failed to resolve tslib /home/daniel/apps/civet/source/esm.civet
      ```
    - [ ] Handle .civet files outside of project root
    - [ ] Handle multi-root projects
    - [ ] Use @danielx/civet installed in node_modules if present
    - [ ] Automate adding import suggestion
    - [ ] Handle file updates
      - [x] Add TextDocuments to service
      - [x] Update docs on changes
      - [x] Update sourcemap/meta on changes
    - [x] Sourcemapping
      - [x] Correctly map runtime errors using source-map-support in esm loader

        - [x] implied `imports` source map to ` from `
      - [ ] ~~Unpessimize source mapping output (later)~~ we actually need nearly every mapping so we can reliably remap from ts-node
      - [x] Translate from generated line/column to source line/column (reverse map)
      - [x] Translate from source line/column to generated line/column
    - [x] Document Symbols
